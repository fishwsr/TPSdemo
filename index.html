    <h2>
      Introduction to TPS
    </h2>
    <p>
      Thin Plate Spline, or TPS for short, is an interpolation
      method that finds a <em>"minimally bended" smooth surface
      that passes through all given points</em>. TPS of 3 control
      points is a plane, more than 3 is generally a curved surface
      and less than 3 is undefined.
    </p>
    <p>
      The name "Thin Plate" comes from the fact that a TPS more or
      less simulates how a thin metal plate would behave if it was
      forced through the same control points.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thin plate splines are particularily popular in representing
      shape transformations, for example, image morphing or shape
      detection. Consider two equally sized sets of 2D-points,
      <em>A</em> being the vertices of the original shape and <em>B</em> of the target
      shape. Let <em>z<sub>i</sub>=B<sub>ix</sub> -
      A<sub>ix</sub></em>. Then fit a TPS over points
      <em>(a<sub>ix</sub>, a<sub>iy</sub>, z<sub>i</sub>)</em> to
      get interpolation function for translation of points in
      <em>x</em> direction. Repeat the same for <em>y</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      In some cases, e.g. when the control point coordinates are
      noisy, you may want to relax the interpolation requirements
      slightly so that the resulting surface doesn't have to go
      exactly exactly through the control points. This is called
      <em>regularization</em> and is controlled by regularization
      parameter <em>&lambda;</em>. If <em>&lambda;</em> is zero,
      interpolation is exact and if it's very large, the resulting
      TPS surface is reduced to a least squares fitted plane
      ("bending energy" of a plane is 0). In our example, the
      regularization parameter is also made scale invariant with an
      extra parameter <em>&alpha;</em>.

    <h3>
      The math
    </h3>
    <p>
      Given set <em>C</em> of <em>p</em> 3D control points....
    </p>
    <div class="menu">
      <img src="gfx/eq1.png" alt="Eq. 1">
    </div>
    <p>
      ...and regularization parameter <em>&lambda;</em>, solve
      unknown TPS weights <em>w</em> and <em>a</em> from from
      linear equation system...
    </p>
    <div class="menu">
      <img src="gfx/eq2.png" alt="Eq. 2">
    </div>
    <p>
      ..., where <em>K</em>, <em>P</em> and <em>O</em> are
      submatrices and <em>w</em>, <em>a</em>, <em>v</em> and
      <em>o</em> are column vectors, given by:
    </p>
    <div class="menu">
      <img src="gfx/eq3.png" alt="Eq. 3">
    </div>
    <p>
      Note that <em>L</em>, and thus also its submatrix <em>K</em>,
      is symmetric so you can calculate elements for upper triangle
      only and copy them to the lower one. Also, &alpha; (mean of
      distances between control points' xy-projections) is a
      constant only present on the diagonal of <em>K</em>, so you
      can easily calculate it while filling up the upper and lower
      triangles.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, once you know values for <em>w</em> and <em>a</em>, you
      can interpolate <em>z</em> for arbitrary points
      <em>(x,y)</em> from:

      Example code
    </h2>
    <p>
      <code>Tpsdemo</code> is an example program, a graphical thin
      plate spline editor that demonstrates how to implement TPS
      interpolation in C++. It uses <a href=
      "http://www.opengl.org/">OpenGL + GLUT</a> for graphics and
      <a href="http://www.boost.org/">Boost uBlas library</a> for
      representing large matrices.

            <em>The package also contains a crude Gauss elimination solver </em>, <code><a href="gauss-elim.h">gauss-elim.h</a></code>, but the LU decomposition is faster
